This folder may hold override templates which are only being used when
the option "Allow templates from overrides directory" is enabled
under Admin->Current Theme. If this option is off (which is the
default setting) all content here is ignored.

Note that the contents of this directory must follow the file
name structure of the main templates folder. So if you want to
override postbits/bits, you must place it into
override/postbits/bits.tpl.

Template overrides provide an easy way to modify an existing
theme without having to install a completely new theme. Note
that template overrides are global and a member cannot choose
to use the original or overriden templates.
